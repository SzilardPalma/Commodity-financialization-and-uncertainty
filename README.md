# Financialization and uncertainty in the commodity market: a Bayesian approach

The Github repository contains the following folders and files of the replication code:
## 1. Model: Financialization - Bayesian factor model with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility
The replication code has the following files:
  - Input1.xlsx: transformed commodity futures data, macroeconomic and financial variables
  - Replication code
  - Posteriors: the posteriors draws analysed in the research
  - plotMat: code to plot the variance decomposition
  - Functions folder: all functions used in the code (most of the functions are written by Haroon Mumtaz)

## 2. Model: Commodity uncertainty - Bayesian factor model with volatility in mean VAR of the regional factors
The replication code has the following files:
  - Input2.xlsx: original and transformed input data
  - Replication code
  - Posteriors: the posterior draws analysed in the research
  - GeneralizedIRF: Impulse response function calculation
  - Functions folder: all functions in the code (most of the functions are written by Haroon Mumtaz)
  - Figures folder: all 6 uncertainty indices and their comparison with other uncertainty indices.
